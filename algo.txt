Goal - calculate Muon decay.

Given the PHYSLITE data, we have the trajectories of what goes on during particle collision in CERN's Large Hadron Collider.
In each event object, we have essentially all readings at that particular slice of time,
namely transverse momentum, pseudorapidity, and azithumal momemntum respective to the transverse plane.

We're given the above data for Electrons, Muons, and Jets.
(Jets = reconstructed objects that represent the visible outcome of high-energy quarks and gluons produced in proton–proton collisions)

Muons however can decay. Namely muon --> muon neutrino + electron + electron-antineutrino (positron)
Given the momenta of these muons, we should be able to calculate not only when they decay,
but the prbable trajectories of the resulting particles.

Simultaneously, we know that strong magnetic fields significantly affect the spin precession of muons, subtly 
tweaking the decay rate, implicitly measured by the spin direction of the decay products.

Given that the result of these proton-proton collisions results in an explosive 'shrapnel' of electrons travelling
near the speed of light, a magnetic field must be produced by each and every moving electron. 

We need to be able to calculate this field in all space and calculate/display the expected muon behavior.
